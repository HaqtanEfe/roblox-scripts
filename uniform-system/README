If understanding the scripts without the explorer tab is an issue. I left the rbxl file in the folder as well.
Hope you find this project good enough for advanced level.
I believe I can make more advanced projects however I don't really get commisions that are advanced these days. So I don't have any current project that can satify the advanced projects requirement.
